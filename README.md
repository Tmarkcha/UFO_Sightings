# UFO Sightings

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a website which includes a dynamic table that can provide analysis of UFO sightings by permitting the user to filter for different criteria simultaneously.

There are several criteria which can be filtered through, and they are:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

## Results

In order to utilize the filter table, there are five different criteria to pick from. The following example illustartes how to operate the filter table:

Type the respective input into the corresponding box. In the figure below, the table is filtered for the state of Texas "tx", and the "enter" key is pressed. All other inputs are left untouched.

## Summary

The main drawback is that one is unable to retain a selected search result. Perhaps the user would like to compare different sightings and see if there is some correlation between different sightings. Upon clearing the input from the filter table, the table reverts back to its original state.

## Recommendations
- Allow the user to "store" a search result and potentially store it into a separate table with other results of interest, so that comparisons may be made.
- To have the filter table scroll down the page alongside the user, so that the user does not have to scroll all the way back up to filter out a specific sighting.
